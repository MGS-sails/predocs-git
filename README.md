# Great Project

Any great project start with a README.md.
Here it is.

## Contributing

There is also some contributing guidelines. I won't set it up, because I am not opiniated enough. But feel free to follow the official [Github guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors).
